# Generate Pitch Deck: Chamberline

Use the `pitch-deck-generator` skill to create a hackathon pitch deck for Chamberline.

## Project Info

**App Name:** Chamberline
**Tagline:** Your portfolio drifts. Chamberline fixes it. Automatically, across every chain.
**Hackathon:** HackMoney 2026
**Accent Color:** #4CAF50 (Lizard Green)

## Problem Narrative

"Imagine you have $100k spread across 5 chains. ETH pumps 40% - suddenly you're overexposed. Your 50/30/20 allocation is now 62/22/16. You're taking on more risk than you planned. To fix it, you need to manually check positions on each chain, figure out what to sell, bridge funds, swap tokens... By the time you're done, the market has moved again."

**Problem Bullets:**
- Drift is constant - ETH pumps 40%, now you're overweight and exposed
- Assets scattered across 5+ chains with no unified view
- Rebalancing is painful - manual bridging, swapping, gas on every chain
- Existing tools show drift but can't fix it

**Problem GIF:** Search for something like "portfolio scattered" or "confused investor"

## Solution

**Transformation:** "From scattered chaos to automatic rebalancing"

**Solution Bullets:**
- Unified view of all assets across every chain
- Set target allocations once (50% ETH, 30% stables, 20% BTC)
- Get drift alerts when you exceed your threshold
- One-click rebalancing via LI.FI + Uniswap v4 across chains

**Solution GIF:** Search for something like "perfectly balanced" or "satisfying organization"

## How It Works

Flow steps:
1. Connect Wallets
2. Set Target Allocation
3. Monitor Drift
4. One-Click Rebalance

## Sponsors & Ecosystem Fit

**Sponsors:** LI.FI, Uniswap v4, Sui

**Why This Matters:**
- Chamberline showcases LI.FI Composer for cross-chain execution
- Demonstrates Uniswap v4 hooks for MEV-protected swaps
- First automated cross-chain portfolio rebalancer that actually executes trades
